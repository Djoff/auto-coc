# Clash of Clans Bot
*Cooler name coming soon...?*

This is my Clash of Clans bot. Built to play Clash of Clans on the [BlueStacks](#)
Android emulator for Windows (built and tested on Windows 8). It is powered by
[SikuliX v1.0.1](#).

See below for setup and usage instructions

## Feature Overview
This bot is fully featured and is capable of amazing things when left to it's
own devices. This includes (but is not limited to):

* Donate troops to clan members
* Train troops, auto-balanced between all barracks
* Collect resources from Elixir Collectors, Gold Mines, and Dark Elixir Drills
* Accurately parse statistics from your village (Gold/Elixir/DE levels, Gems, etc.)
* Raid other villages according to configurable farming goals
	* Gold/Elixir/DE heavy emphasis
	* Balanced loot
	* Etc.
* Track raid statistics for later review and analysis
